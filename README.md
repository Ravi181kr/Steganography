# Steganography
Steganography is the practice of hiding a secret message within a non-secret file, image, or message. The word steganography comes from the Greek words steganos which means "hidden" or "covered" and graph which means "to write". 
In this project,we are hiding our message within an Image,which we may later decrypt and gain the original message.
